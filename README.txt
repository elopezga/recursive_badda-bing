Creates a badda-bing figure in Matlab/Octave. This was written in Octave, but should work with
Matlab as well.

To run, simply call the BaddaBing function within your script. It is not recommended that you
change any of the square internal variables within BaddaBing() as this might make the figure
appear ugly.
